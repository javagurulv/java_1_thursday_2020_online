    /* ArrayList and LinkedList.
    Java ArrayList class uses a dynamic array for storing the elements.
    It is like an array, but there is no size limit.
    We can add or remove elements anytime. So, it is much more flexible than the traditional array.
    It is found in the java.util package.

    A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.
    The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.
    In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field
    and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.
