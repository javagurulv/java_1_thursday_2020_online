1) Go to Control Panel-->Program and Features and check if Java /JDK is listed there.

2) Open command prompt and type java -version. If you get the version info, Java is installed correctly and PATH is also set correctly.

3) Go to start menu-->System-->Advanced-->Environment Variables. Check if both PATH and JAVA_HOME are set correctly. This can also be done by using the "set" command on the command prompt.

4) If none of the above work, search you file system for javac.exe If you find it , set PATH (should point to the bin directory) and JAVA_HOME (should point to the parent directory of the bin directory) in environment variables mentioned in the above point.
